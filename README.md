Projecting Arrays

Applying a function to a value and creating a new value is called a projection. To project one array into another, we apply a projection function to each item in the array and collect the results in a new array

All array projections share two operations in common:

Traverse the source array
Add each item's projected value to a new array

Predicate : Applying a new function

```
// map()

[1,2,3].map(function(x) { return x + 1 })                       === [2,3,4]
seq([1,,,2,,,3]).map(function(x) { return x + 1})               === seq([2,,,3,,,4])
seq([1,,,2,,,3,,,]).map(function(x) { return x + 1 })           === seq([2,,,3,,,4,,,])

// filter()

[1,2,3].filter(function(x) { return x > 1; })                   === [2,3]
seq([1,,,2,,,3]).filter(function(x) { return x > 1; })          === seq([2,,,3])
seq([1,,,2,,,3,,,]).filter(function(x) { return x > 1; })       === seq([2,,,3,,,])

// concatAll()

[ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ].concatAll()                             === [1,2,3,4,5,6]
seq([ seq([1,,,2,,,3]),,,seq([4,,,5,,,6]) ]).concatAll()         === seq([1,,,2,,,3,,,4,,,5,,,6])

// If a new sequence arrives before all the items
// from the previous sequence have arrived, no attempt
// to retrieve the new sequence's elements is made until
// the previous sequence has completed. As a result the
// order of elements in the sequence is preserved.
seq([
	seq([1,,,, ,2, ,3])
	,,,seq([,,4, ,5, ,,6]) ]).
	concatAll()                                                  === seq([1,,,,,2,,3,,4,,5,,,6])

// Notice that as long as at least one sequence being
// concatenated is incomplete, the concatenated sequence is also
// incomplete.
seq([
	seq([1,, ,,, ,,,2,,,3])
	,,,seq([4,,,5,,, ,,, ,,6,,,]) ]).
	concatAll()                                                  === seq([1,,,4,,,5,,,2,,,3,,,6,,,])

// reduce()

[ 1, 2, 3 ].reduce(sumFunction)                                 === [ 6 ]
seq([ 1,,,2,,,3 ]).reduce(sumFunction)                          === seq([,,,,,,6])

// Reduced sequences do not complete until the
// sequence does.
seq([ 1,,,2,,,3,,, ]).reduce(sumFunction)                       === seq([ ,,,,,,,,,])

// zip()

// In both Arrays and Observables, the zipped sequence
// completes as soon as either the left or right-hand
// side sequence completes.
Array.zip([1,2],[3,4,5], sumFunction)                           === [4,6]
Observable.zip(seq([1,,,2]),seq([3,,,4,,,5]), sumFunction)      === seq([4,,,6])

// take()
[1,2,3].take(2)                                                 === [1, 2]
seq([ 1,,,2,,,3 ]).take(2)                                      === seq([ 1,,,2 ])
seq([ 1,,,2,,,3,,, ]).take(2)                                   === seq([ 1,,,2 ])

// takeUntil()

// takeUntil works for Arrays, but it's not very useful
// because the result will always be an empty array.
[1,2,3].takeUntil([1])                                          === []

seq([1,,,2,,,3,,, ]).takeUntil(
seq([ ,,, ,,4 , }))                                             === seq([ 1,,,2 ])
```

Observable is like an array for asynchronous attributes like - events (DOM request), HTTP requests
